BFT-CBA Business Feasibility Tool-Cost Benefit Analisys

What the tool/component is about:  

This component presents a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to provide decision makers with objective economic data on how much a migration would cost, 
compared to what the current system costs and what a new system developed from scratch would cost.
This CBA calculates when the invested money will 
be returned (Payback), the Net Present Value of the migration and the ROI of the migration in a 5 year long period.

It also provides a simulation of the three most used models in service based business models: Pay per use, Freemium,Tiered.


Current functionality:

The current version provides the breakdown of 
the costs (one time and recurring) and benefits of the system, and which can be manually modified. Future versions will include a catalogue in the form of a drop-down 
list and transferred to the other worksheets. It also provides a simulation of financial metrics (EBITDA) obtained when applying any of the three proposed business model (ay per use, Freemium,Tiered)
