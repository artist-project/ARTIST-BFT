  <mainDescription>The SLA should contain issues such as: SLA could be:&lt;br />&#xD;
- Conditions under which the service is considered to be unavailable (e.g. if the service is offered at several&#xD;
locations)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
 - Availability targets (exact definition of how the agreed availability levels will be calculated, based on agreed service&#xD;
time and downtime)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
 - Reliability targets&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
- Maintainability targets&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
- Down times for maintenance&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
- Restrictions on maintenance, e.g. allowed maintenance windows, seasonal restrictions on maintenance, and procedures to&#xD;
announce planned service interruptions &lt;br />&#xD;
- Definitions of Major Incidents &lt;br />&#xD;
- Requirements regarding availability reporting&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;

users, Business cycles (daily, weekly) and seasonal variations.&lt;br />&#xD;
- Response times from applications &lt;br />&#xD;
- Requirements for scalability (assumptions for the medium and long-term increase in workload and service utilization)&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
- Requirements regarding capacity and performance reporting &lt;br />&#xD;
- Time within which a defined level of service must be re-established &lt;br />&#xD;
- Time within which normal service levels must be restored&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
 - Responsibilities: Duties of the service provider, of the customer and of service users (e.g. with respect to IT&#xD;
security) &lt;br />&#xD;
- IT Security aspects to be observed when using the service (if applicable, references to relevant IT Security Policies)&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
